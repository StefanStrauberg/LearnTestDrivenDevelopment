# LearnTestDrivenDevelopment
Main goal of this repo is the view about what is the TDD approach and how it implements

### What is Test Driven Development
- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process on software requirement being written as test cases before real code writen.
- The process of ensuring that just enough code is written to fulfill a requirement.
- A methods that introduces testing upfront, giving your code better long term coverage.
- Guards your code against potential breaking future modifications.

### Why is Unit Testing Important
- Makes you think about writing testable code.
- Usually leads to clean and succinct code and the use of good practices.
- Helps you to test code more quickly, to match against requirements.
- You can start building the business logic from earlier, even before building an applications.
- Helps to guard code against potential breaking changes.
- Can be used as documentation for existing code. Test scenarios can help to explain why the code was written the way it was.
